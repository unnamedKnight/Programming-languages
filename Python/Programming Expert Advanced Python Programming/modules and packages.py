"""
Module and Packages help us to better organize our python code.
A Python module is just a python file.
So anything that ends with .py file extension is a python module.
And a Python Package is simply a directory / folder containing Python modules.
So this allows us to better separate our code and organize it.
"""


# - When we execute a python file in the terminal it works as the main module
# - __init__.py makes a folder a python package
