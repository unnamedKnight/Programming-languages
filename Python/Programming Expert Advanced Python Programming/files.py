# - When we use file.read() it will give us all the text inside the file
# - When we use file.readlines() it will give us a list of all the lines in the file
# - We can use replace method to remove white space from the middle of a sentence

# - When we are using write mode we have to be careful, Because write mode not only creates new files
# - It also override the same existing file

# - Append mode appends at the end of an existing file
# - In append mode we are not overwriting the file we are just appending new data at the end of the file
